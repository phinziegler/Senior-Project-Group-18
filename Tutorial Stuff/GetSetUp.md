# Getting Set Up
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd Senior-Project-Group-18`
3. create a file called `.env` and store it in the root directory. This file will be used to assign environment variables.
4. add the line `NODE_ENV='production'` to `.env`
5. `npm run start-local`. This will install all dependencies, create a build, and then open it in the browser. The installation process can take several minutes to complete.
6. When you want to shut down the server you must type `ctrl + c` in the terminal.
